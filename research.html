                                        <p>I started my journey in computer science through Iranian National Olympiad of Informatics (INOI). I started reading about theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics in high school. After two years of practice and two national level exams, I was accepted as one of the 30 members who got admitted for INOI camps. There I get the chance to learn more about algorithms design, data structures, and programming during summer and winter camps. I learnt to solve problems by designing algorithms and became fluent in writing codes in C++. After one year of intense competition, I received the silver medal in INOI.</p>

                                                    <p>I pursued my interest in computer science by studying computer engineering as my undergraduate degree. During my second year of college, I started doing research on graph theory at the department of Mathematics. Nevertheless, following my first project, I found myself fascinated about human behavior while I attended my first journal club at the Social Neuroscience and Psychopathology research group at Tehran University of Medical Sciences. There I get the chance to collaborate and work on several research project on human behavior. However, my personal line of research in the group was on evolution of altruistic behavior. I utilized game theory and genetic algorithms to do research on evolution of cooperation and altruistic behavior. My bachelor thesis titled “A Computational Model on Coevolution of Cooperation and Response to Inequity” is one of the outputs of my research during this period.</p>

                                                    <p>Following my bachelor’s degree, I co-founded EPie, a web application development company focused on developing fully trailered from-scratch solutions for large companies. Instead of developing software solutions, we focused on developing a programming framework and a strong code generator to make from-scratch development fast and inexpensive. This competitive advantage let us be fully flexible in meeting the requirements of our clients, while providing the solution at a reasonable price. </p>

I took the national university entrance exam for MBA studies and ranked 21 among around 30,000 participants. The MBA program helped me to develop more understanding about business and social sciences and add that to my knowledge set in computer science. I learnt about topics such as economics, marketing, strategy, finance, etc. During my MBA I realized that I want to pursue education by getting a PhD in an interdisciplinary field, where I can follow my interest in human behavior, computer science and business.</p>

As a marketing empirical research, I get to pass courses in economics, psychology and computer science. This program in addition to my previous education in computer science and business equipped me with the understanding I need to tackle marketing related problems for businesses. In 2017 I joined adobe as a data science intern and collaborate with them on two independent research projects for more than two years.</p>
